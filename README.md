Hi! Welcome to Host Me N U! 
Because of my lofe for hosting, cooking, and creating I decided to make an application to help me host my next dinner party.

This tool will allow you to organize and plan a dinner menu. In the application, you will be able to access your own personal database of entrees, cocktails, and desserts. Here, you can update, or change or delete these recipes, and generate a menu for guests!

There are 5 pages in my application, the HomePage, Entree page, Cocktail page, Dessert page, and Menu Generator!

Users can login with their unique usernames, and access their recipe collections. 

I used MongoDB for my database creation.
I created my ReSTful API using Node and Express.
I used axios to retrieve data from my api. 
For my front end, I used React and React Router for page navigation, and react hooks for state management.
